## Third Week

#### Tasks for Third Week
 
Learn the basics of Machine Learning and implement it in Scikit Learn
 - [ ] K-means Clustering
 - [ ] Linear Regression
 - [ ] Logistic Regression


 ##### K-means Clustering

 K-means Clustering is when there are a number of means in a plane and we want to add some points to each cluster, according to the distances to these means. But when the points get added to the clusters, the mean of the cluster gets dislocated. So we will again cluster them according to the distances to the mean. This process is repeated till there will not be any change.
